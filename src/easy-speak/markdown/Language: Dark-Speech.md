## About

> There exists a language so dire, so inherently full of spite, malice, corruption, and hatred that it is simply called the Dark Speech. This is the secret language of evil gods, so foul and so potent that even demons and devils refrain from its use, lest it consume them.
>
> ~Book of Vile Darkness

Each word is full of dread power that could be used to provoke emotions, empower magic, or corrupt physical objects. The warlock invocation *baleful utterance* is a mere syllable of Dark Speech. Mortals who dare to wield it risk their sanity, for Dark Speech is not merely a tool—it is an expression of malevolence that reshapes both the speaker and the listener.

The language's potency lies in its dual nature as a weapon and a tool of communication. To hear it is to feel despair seep into one's soul; to speak it is to let the essence of corruption momentarily inhabit your very being. The darkest rites of necromancers, cultists, and those who serve the gods of chaos often rely on fragments of Dark Speech to invoke their terrible power. Its use is restricted, feared, and rarely mastered by even the most daring practitioners of forbidden arts.

### Sound

Conveyed usually between telepathic beings, the verbal and somatic aspects of Dark Speech are layered atop one another in seemingly contradictory riddles, punctuated by bold, attention-grabbing statements. These expressions evoke dread, depression, guilt, and self-deprecation, twisting the emotions of those who hear or perceive it. To understand the sound of Dark Speech is to glimpse into the abyss of despair, its echoes capable of lingering long after the words have been spoken.

### Script

Because the Gnomish language has rich nuances and depth of representation, when Dark Speech is written by mortals they use Gnomish pictographs. However, the only way to properly convey the language is with esoteric symbology.
