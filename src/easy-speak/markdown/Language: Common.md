## About

Common is the universal trade language spoken across most civilized lands. It serves as the lingua franca for merchants, adventurers, diplomats, and anyone who needs to communicate across cultural boundaries. Nearly every sentient creature learns at least a smattering of Common, making it the default language of commerce, negotiation, and everyday interaction.

### Sound

Common sounds like whatever language the players at your table speak. It is practical, direct, and lacks the melodic flourishes of Elvish or the guttural weight of Dwarvish. Its strength lies in its accessibility—anyone can learn it, and everyone can understand it.

### Script

The Common alphabet is straightforward and widely taught. Most written documents, from legal contracts to tavern menus, are penned in Common script. Its simplicity has made literacy more widespread than it might otherwise be.
