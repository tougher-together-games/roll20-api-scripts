## About

Sylvan is often seen as the language of nature, as its speakers are often nature spirits and creatures. The language itself is fairly old, and has changed very little throughout the ages. It flows easily, similarly to Elvish; in fact many linguists believe that the Elvish language is derived from Sylvan.

### Sound

The Sylvan language flows like a melody woven from the sounds of the natural world—gentle rustling leaves, murmuring brooks, and the harmonious calls of woodland creatures. Its lilting tones, elongated vowels, and soft consonants create an ethereal, song-like quality, with each word blending seamlessly into the next. Subtle variations in pitch and rhythm infuse it with layers of meaning, evoking the playful yet enigmatic nature of the fey. Even in anger, Sylvan retains an elegance, its sharper sounds resembling snapping twigs or distant thunder. To hear it spoken is to feel the pulse of the wild—a language that embodies the magic and beauty of nature itself.

### Script

Fey creatures do not usually write anything down, being long lived and apart from the concerns of the mundane world. When they do, often times it is transcribed in Elvish script. However, the evolution of a script by Noble Fey in the Sellie and Unsellie court have created the Eladrin script.
