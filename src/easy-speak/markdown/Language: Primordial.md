## About

Before recorded history, there were protobeings. Their language was primordial, like the plane they resided on, and as time went on the language evolved into many different dialects such as Abyssal, Aquan, Auran, Giant, Ignan, and Terran. The primordial language (and most of its derivatives) use the barazhad alphabet; an etched, flourished, runic system. It is sometimes represented with dwarven runes. The language itself predates most of civilization, and its origins are unknown. The language is dead and is not spoken by any living peoples or cultures, though some particularly ancient and powerful elementals and outsiders still remember it.

### Sound

Most dialects of Primordial can be understood by other dialects. The sound is a bit different from one elemental speaker to another.

### Script

Originally Barazhad as with the oldest languages, but not uncommon to see it transcribed in Dethek.
